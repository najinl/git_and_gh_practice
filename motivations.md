I have been motivated to change my career because I'd like more work/life balance. My previous industry had a culture of excessive overtime due to unrealistic deadlines, which was often caused by the narrow window for both construction funding and conducive weather for construction. My partner and I want to raise a family and I know that in my old industry it would be very difficult to be the type of involved parent I'd like to be and excel. I think that becoming a developer will still satisfy the problem solving challenges I enjoy while offering better life balance.
