Favorite Hobbies:
  1. Climbing - Tests my strength and discipline. Takes me to beautiful places and I've met interesting people along the way.
  2. Painting - I predominately paint using water colors. I've never considered myself very artistic, but when the pandemic hit I started to spend hours painting. I surprised myself...I'm not half bad and it is so distressing!
